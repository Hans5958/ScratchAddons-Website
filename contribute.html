<h1>Contribute</h1>

<div class="container">
	<p>Contributing to Scratch Addons is easy! Simply go to the <a href="https://github.com/ScratchAddons/ScratchAddons/">GitHub repository</a> for Scratch Addons and fork it! Once you have made changes to it that you would like in the official addon feel free to start a PR (Pull Request) with your changes. If <a href="https://github.com/WorldLanguages">World_Languages</a> and <a href="https://github.com/apple502j">apple502j</a> review your code and think it's good your changes will be put into the official addon!</p>
	<p>If you can't code or would just like to help with the discussion and suggestions for the addon feel free to comment and contribute in the <a href="https://github.com/ScratchAddons/ScratchAddons/issues">issues tab</a> of Scratch Addons. There you can suggest new addons to be added, help with the coding a little, and much more!</p>
	
	<p class="author-notes">There is still a need for improvements, especially the wording of the content. I don't even know why this page is needed on the main website. This thing should better be put on either the GitHub repo or the documentation.</p>
